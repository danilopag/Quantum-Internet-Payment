The key features of NetSquid include:

- The use of a discrete event simulator to simulate delays in transmission and computation.
- Extendable libraries of network components and protocols.
- Multiple qubit *quantum state formalisms* available: trade offs include versatility, speed, and memory efficiency.
- A Python 3 package that uses Numpy/SciPy, Cython, and C++ under the hood.
