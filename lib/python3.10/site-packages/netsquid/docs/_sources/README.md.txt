NetSquid: the Network Simulator for Quantum Information using Discrete events
=============================================================================

The Python package NetSquid provides a quantum network simulation platform by integrating the quantum information processing capabilities of a quantum computing simulator with the event-driven time management of a classical network simulator.
It is particularly well suited to the modeling and simulation of next generation quantum networks, for example networks capable of generating and utilizing entanglement between remote nodes.
Under the hood NetSquid uses the discrete event simulation engine pyDynAA and makes use of compiled C extensions (via Cython) for fast performance.
It is being developed for the QuTech [Quantum Internet division](https://qutech.nl/research-engineering/quantum-internet/) as a collaboration between TNO and TUDelft.

The documentation for NetSquid, including a tutorial and examples, is available [online](https://docs.netsquid.org/) and in the _docs/_ directory of the python package.
A paper about the NetSquid simulator and several of its use cases is available [online](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42005-021-00647-8) ([ArXiv link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.12535).
