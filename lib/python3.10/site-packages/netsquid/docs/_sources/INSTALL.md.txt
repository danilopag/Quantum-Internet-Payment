Installing the NetSquid package
===============================

> *Below we describe how to install the NetSquid package as a user.*
> *If you are a developer wanting to build and install NetSquid from source see the [INSTALL-SOURCE.md](INSTALL-SOURCE.md) file.*

The prerequisites for the user installation of NetSquid are:
- A modern Linux or MacOS 64-bit (x86_64) operating system. If you don't have linux you could run it via virtualization, e.g. using [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/). If you have Windows 10 you can also use the [Bash on Ubuntu](https://www.howtogeek.com/249966/how-to-install-and-use-the-linux-bash-shell-on-windows-10/) subsystem.
- Python version 3.6 or higher.
- The python package installer [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) **version 19 or higher**. To upgrade your current pip version run `pip3 install --upgrade pip`.
- Several Python package dependencies that will be downloaded and installed automatically if necessary, including the *pydynaa* package.

Installing using the NetSquid server
------------------------------------

NetSquid can be installed by pointing the [Python _pip_ installer](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/user_guide/#user-installs) to NetSquid's private [python package index](https://pypi.org/) server.
To download from this server you will need your *login credentials* for the [NetSquid forum](https://forum.netsquid.org) ([registration](https://forum.netsquid.org/ucp.php?mode=register) is free).

To install the Netsquid python package run the following command from a terminal:
```
pip3 install --user --extra-index-url https://<username>:<password>@pypi.netsquid.org netsquid
```
substituting the `<username>` and `<password>` fields for your *NetSquid forum login details*.
To install the package system-wide (for all users) or within a virtual environment remove the `--user` argument.

> *If your authentication with the pypi server stops working it may be because you have made too many failed attempts. To reset this counter log into the forum website again directly, and then try again.*

If pip fails to install NetSquid due to a missing version, this indicates your system doesn't match one of the builds available on [the pypi server](https://pypi.netsquid.org/netsquid).
First please verify you satisfy the prerequisites mentioned above. 
If the installation still fails, feel free to report it on the [forum](https://forum.netsquid.org).

Installing using a wheel file
-----------------------------

If you have received a binary wheel distribution (`.whl` file) of NetSquid it is important that your system's architecture, operating system, and major Python version  match that of the file.
For example, the file `netsquid-0.5.1-cp36m-linux_x86_64.whl` is intended for a linux OS running on a 64 bit architecture with Python 3.6 (i.e. cp36m).

This file can be installed using the [Python _pip_ installer](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/user_guide/#user-installs). For example, to install locally as a user run:
```
pip3 install --user netsquid-0.5.1-cp36m-linux_x86_64.whl
```
To install the package system-wide (for all users) or within a virtual environment remove the `--user` argument.

Verifying the installation
--------------------------

To check your installation was successful you can run the test suite within Python:

```python
import netsquid as ns
ns.test()
```
