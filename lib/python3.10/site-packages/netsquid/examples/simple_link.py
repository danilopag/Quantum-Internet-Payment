In this example we will look at achieving robust entanglement
generation by defining a simple quantum *link layer* protocol.
This example is inspired by the quantum link layer proposed by `Dahlberg et al <https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.09778>`_.
In this paper the following quantum network stack is defined in analogy to the classical OSI stack:

.. image:: ../images/layers_LL.png
    :width: 400
    :align: center
    :alt: The five layers of the quantum network stack.

The bottom or *physical layer* is responsible for executing entanglement generation *attempts* when requested.
These attempts can succeed or fail, and this information is propagated to the *link layer*,
which is responsible for generating this entanglement in a robust manner.
The link layer receives requests from the network layer to
create entanglement and will respond with success once this is achieved.

In this example will be explore simplified implementations for the physical and link layer protocols.
Before we dive into the protocols let us describe an example physical network in NetSquid,
which will have the following layout:

Alice and Bob will use a *single-click scheme* to generate *heralded entanglement* (see paper).
The quantum and classical channels and the detector required to generate
the entanglement are contained within a heralded connection.
We will request the entanglement generator at Alice, who will use the classical connection to
synchronize the requests with Bob.
A node contains a Quantum Processor which is connected to the heralded connection.

The network is setup as follows:

.. literalinclude:: ../../netsquid/examples/simple_link.py
    :pyobject: create_example_network

Let us now define the needed protocols.
The *physical layer* and the *link layer* work together very closely, therefore we will give a
full overview of both protocols first, before diving into their implementation.

The *link layer* should respond to CREATE requests, which are issued from the *network* layer.
A CREATE request specifies in our case the number of qubits pairs we want to generate.
For this example we assume the request to generate three qubits just arrived at Alice.
The protocol works as follows:

  1. The link layer receives the request from the network layer.
  2. The request is synchronized with the other node.
  3. Every 100 ns the physical layer sends a trigger to the link layer.
  4. On the trigger from the physical layer the link layer responds with the first queued request.
  5. The link layers send a response to their physical layer with instructions.
  6. The physical layer protocols create a qubit-photon pair using their quantum processors
     and send the photon to the heralded connection.
  7. When both photons arrive at the detector of the heralded connection, they are measured.
  8. The heralded connection informs the physical layer of the measurement outcome.
  9. The measurement outcome is propagated to the link layer, which can now
     decide to send a response to the network layer.
  10. Repeat step 5-9 until the desired number of pairs is created.

The physical layer we implement using the ``MidpointHeraldingProtocol`` (MHP) protocol, whereas
the link layer is implemented using an ``EGProtocol``, where EG is an acronym for entanglement generation.
The MHP should trigger the EGP on a fixed timer, and start
the entanglement generation process on a response from the EGP.
This is implemented as shown below:

.. literalinclude:: ../../netsquid/examples/simple_link.py
    :pyobject: MidpointHeraldingProtocol

The EGP is defined as a *service*: a protocol that defines the interface the network layer can use more explicitly.
We can split our protocol into two parts: handling input of requests and handling the requests themselves.
We will use the service to handle the input of requests, and the actual
handling of the requests will be implemented by a protocol.
In `an extention of this example <learn.examples.magic_simple_link.html>`_ we will reuse
the service but create a new protocol.
Our EGP can't handle multiple requests at once, so we use a queue to schedule the requests.
The service is implemented as shown below with an abstract request handler:

.. literalinclude:: ../../netsquid/examples/simple_link.py
    :pyobject: EGService

The synchronization and request handling can now be defined in the protocol:

.. literalinclude:: ../../netsquid/examples/simple_link.py
    :pyobject: EGProtocol

We have skipped over the heralded connection, so we will address it now.
The connection contains a detector in order to measure the incoming photons.
In this example we have the detector in the middle of the connection.

    +----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

.. literalinclude:: ../../netsquid/examples/simple_link.py
    :pyobject: HeraldedConnection

The main part of the heralded connection is the BSMDetector, so in the code shown below we will address it.

.. literalinclude:: ../../netsquid/examples/simple_link.py
    :pyobject: BSMDetector

Together these parts allow for robust entanglement generation.
We still need to setup the protocols.
A mockup Network layer will send the request to the link layer at Alice.
By making the EGP a subprotocol of the Network layer it will automatically stop when
the Network layer has no more requests.

.. literalinclude:: ../../netsquid/examples/simple_link.py
    :pyobject: NetworkProtocol

Finally we put the protocols on the nodes.

.. literalinclude:: ../../netsquid/examples/simple_link.py
    :pyobject: setup_protocol

We can run our simulation by calling the following:

.. literalinclude:: ../../netsquid/examples/simple_link.py
    :pyobject: run_simulation

Which will give us the following output:

>>> from netsquid.examples.simple_link import run_simulation
>>> run_simulation()
Waiting for responses with create_id 1
Qubits between Alice and Bob with purpose_id 4:
   2078020: [Qubit('QS#790-0'), Qubit('QS#791-0')] with create_id 1
   7506520: [Qubit('QS#2874-0'), Qubit('QS#2875-0')] with create_id 1
  18363520: [Qubit('QS#7042-0'), Qubit('QS#7043-0')] with create_id 1
Waiting for responses with create_id 2
Waiting for responses with create_id 3
Qubits between Alice and Bob with purpose_id 6:
  20400020: [Qubit('QS#7820-0'), Qubit('QS#7822-0')] with create_id 2
  22437010: [Qubit('QS#8604-0'), Qubit('QS#8602-0')] with create_id 2
Qubits between Alice and Bob with purpose_id 4:
  25828520: [Qubit('QS#9904-0'), Qubit('QS#9906-0')] with create_id 3
Finished all network requests

We could give this Protocol much more functionality to better represent the design of the paper.
For example, in the request one could specify a minimum fidelity or maximum generation time.
To reach a minimum fidelity one requires some kind of entanglement distillation.
Changing the bright state population of the qubit-photon pair can change the success probability, and
thus change the generation time.
Using entanglement swapping it is possible to create entanglement between nodes which aren't directly connected.
This process builds upon the robust entanglement generation scheme shown in this example.

    This protocol sends a trigger to an EGProtocol every ``time_step`` nanoseconds.
    On a response the protocol creates a qubit in memory, entangles it with a photon,

    This port is expected to forward the photon to the heralded connection.
    This connection is expected to return an outcome of the photon measurement,
    which returns 1 or 2 (each denotes an entangled state) for success.
    The photon will be generated on position 0, and the qubits on 1 .. N.
